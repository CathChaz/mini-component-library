Working on this project helped me understand how to build UI
components step by step instead of trying to do everything at once.

## Key Things I Learned

- I learned to break UI into small, reusable pieces
- I understood how to use AI as a helper, not something to blindly copy
- I became better at debugging simple issues like missing CSS links
- I learned that simplicity makes components easier to understand
- I gained confidence working with pure HTML and CSS
