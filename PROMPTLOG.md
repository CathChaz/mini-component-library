This file documents how I used AI as a pair programmer, what I accepted, what I modified, and mistakes I identified.

I asked AI to create button styles in CSS.

### What I accepted

- Button padding and border-radius

### Mistakes AI made

1. Disabled button was not clearly styled
2. Class names were not simple
3. Styles were more complex than needed

### Extra issue I fixed

- CSS file was not linked initially, which prevented styles from showing.
